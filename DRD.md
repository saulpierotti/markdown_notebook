# DNA and RNA dynamics

## Introduction
* Professor works in human aging
* Module 1 has a written test, module 2 a report (of course)
* Final score is 20 (module 1) + 10 (module 2)
* Experimental questions should be focused
* Again omics
* In an experiment I have to consider experimental and biological variability
* We can find nucleosomes in blood deriving from apoptotic bodies
	* They are found in microvescicoles
	* Sometimes they can also be free and in this case they are dangerous
* In the lab of prof. Capri they tryed to see if the nucleosome-associated DNA in blood is different in young, old people and centenarians
	* They work a lot with centenarians and they are so proud of it
* CpG metilating/demetilating enzymes: TET (Ten Eleven Translocation), DNMTs
* CpG metilation happens at position 5 of C
* High expression is associated with high gene metilation and low promoter metilation
	* The causality is not so clear
* The metaorganism: nDNA, mtDNA, microbiome
* Astronauts could be ageing faster
	* They want to check their DNA associated with nucleosomes before going, after landing and after a while after landing
* I should do technical replicates
* Coefficient of variability: (SD/mean)*100
* The normal distribution
* Biological variability: usually a lot
* I can distinguish biological and experimental variability by carefully designing my experiment
* Box plot: look at data distribution
	* The central line is the median (quartile Q2)
	* The sides of the box are the quartiles Q1 and Q3
	* The lines are 1.5*IQR above/below Q1/Q3
	* Interquartile range (IQR) is Q3-Q1
	* Outliers outside of the lines are shown
