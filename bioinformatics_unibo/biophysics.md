* The course is made of elements, it is not a complete course
* We want to understand biomolecules
* Structure-function relationship
* The scale of things
* I don't know something if I cannot describe it with a model
	* A model is an equation
* Laser time dependent X ray cristallography allows to see a molecule "breathing"
* The deeper you go in resolution, the more you have to increase the perturbation
	* Bragg diffraction theorem
* Life makes sense only in the light of thermodynamics
* A cell is held together by London forces
* Freeze fracturing
* Atomic force microscope
* rita.casadio@unibo.it
* Complexity means that there are emergent proprieties
	* We do not have models that can predict a cell from its components
* Mitosis, meiosis, apoptosis, developmental biology
* Protein synthesis
* In a cell there are at least 240k different proteins
	* Their relative concentration is of paramount importance
* We are able to label all the neurons in a mouse brain

* I came late
* Bonds can be polar
* Ionic bonds are $2.7/3\AA$ long, and around -5 to -10 Kcal/mol
* Covalent bonds are around 100 Kcal/mol and they show an optimal nuclear distance, which is the bond lenght ($1-1.4\AA$)
	* The typical C-C bond is $1.4\AA$
* Bond lenghts are calculated by X-ray diffraction studies, bond strenghts with calorimetry
* Disulphide bond are around -40 Kcal/mol, $2.07\AA$
	* This bond is stable in an oxydized ambient
* Redox ambient potential describes the tendency of molecules in an environment to lose or acquire electrons
* Steric hindrance
