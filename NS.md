* Most of the neuronal disease are sporadic and not genetic
* It is difficult to develop an animal model for a sporadic disease
* iPSCs from patients are a good alternative
* We are not able to obtain iPSCs from microglia and some interneurons
* Most of our models are 2D, but using 3D models is really important (organoids)
* Brain organoids are good for studying brain development
* Half of the neurons are in the cerebellum
* Microglial cells are monocites, with different embriological origin that all the other glial cells
	* They are the only cells able to pass the BBB
* Neuron signal speed is related to myelination and fiber diameter
