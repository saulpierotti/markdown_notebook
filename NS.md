# Neuroscience
* The human brain has more that $1*10^{11}$ neurons
* Neuroscience started in 1800 with Golgi and Cajal with their accurate description of nerve cells
	* Golgi developped silver staining of neurons
* The cerebrum is composed of 2 emispheres, each composed of 4 lobes
	* The lobes are named after the skull bones above them as frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal
* Motor and sensory pathways are crossed: the left emisphere controls and receives information from the right side of the body and vice-versa
* The 2 emispheres are not completely symmetrical in structure and function
* Lobes are composed of gyri separated by sulci
	* The main gyri are quite conserved in different people and they have names
	* They allow to host more neurons in the same space (increase surface)
* The first evidence of functional specilization in the brain came from the stufy of aphasia after stroke in the Broca area
* At the beginning of neuroscience there were 2 main views according to where brain function is located: holistic and discrete
* Broca area was found to be responsible for speech production and it is coveniently located in the association area just in front of the primary motor cortex that controls the mouth
	* It is usually located in the left emisphere in the posterior region of the frontal lobe, close to the central sulcus
	* Native languages and languages acquired later activate different parts of Broca area!
* Wernicke area is responsible for speech comprehension and it is located just in from of the primary auditory cortex
	* It is connected to the angular gyrus, an association area that integrates auditory, visual and other sensory information
* The arcuate fasciculus connects the Broca area, the angular gyrus and the Wernicke area
* Broadmann's brain classification is regions is still widely used today
* Wernicke and Broca areas seem to be where the grammatical rules of language are stored
	* Each language shares an universal grammar, and so this can be at least in part hard-wired


* Most of the neuronal disease are sporadic and not genetic
* It is difficult to develop an animal model for a sporadic disease
* iPSCs from patients are a good alternative
* We are not able to obtain iPSCs from microglia and some interneurons
* Most of our models are 2D, but using 3D models is really important (organoids)
* Brain organoids are good for studying brain development
* Half of the neurons are in the cerebellum
* Microglial cells are monocites, with different embriological origin that all the other glial cells
	* They are the only cells able to pass the BBB
* Neuron signal speed is related to myelination and fiber diameter
