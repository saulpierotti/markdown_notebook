# Introduction to Big Data Processing Infrastructures

## Introduction
* This course is not about Big Data, it is about infrastructures
* We should have visited a datacenter, but... Corona
* We need SSH, a little bit of C/C++, vim, Python
* We will use AWS and Google Cloud computing!
* Of course we will make a project and an oral exam
* Prof of course is a physicist of the IIFN
* The IIFN-CNAF hosts the Tier-1 datacenter in Bologna

## Setting up AWS
* It is a pay for use model
* You have at the beginning a 50\$ credit
