# Introduction
* Hydrogens bond are mainly located at the level of the backbone
* The reference source in the filed is the Journal of Bioinformatics
* Functional annotation is the core of this course
* Functional annotation studies the relationship between structure and function
* Functional annotation requires data collection, storage and analysis
* Functional annotation is the activity of attributing structural and functional features to translated protein sequences
* Before starting data analysis, be sure of the quality of your data (!)
* A database must be implemented, curated and mined
* Database curation refers to updating the data and to keeping them compliant with the database standard
* A database release is its content at a given date
* Data mining is the retrieval of information from a database
	* It is done with a browser
* In Hamburg there is an EMBL faicility that uses X-rays in a flow citometer

# Random
* Affinity among molecules comes from the electron densities

# X-ray cristallography
* I can understand that I have a protein crystal by shining light on it and seeing how it diffracts
* Routinely X-ray diffraction is not able to locate hydrogens
* Each crystal has a unit cell
* Electron density is the result of data analysis on diffraction maps
* The main cristallographic techniques are NMR and X-rays
* X-rays are used because they have a wavelenght comparable to an atomic bond, and therefore they can resolve with that level of detail
* X-ray sources used for studying protein structure are rotating anode tubes or synchrotrons
* In the rotating anode tube electrons are accelerated towards the anode in a vacuum
	* The anode rotates, so to expose a different portion to the electron beam at each moment and avoid damage
	* X-rays are releades when the electrons collide with the anode, as a way to get rid of their kinetic energy
	* Only 1% of the kinetic energy is converted to photons, the rest heats up the anode
* Sychrothron source give an anisotrope beam, which gives semicircles in the diffraction map instead of focused spot
	* They are located in the US, Europe or Japan
	* X-rays are produced by charged particles moving in a magnetic field
* In order to have a diffraction pattern you need to have interference between the diffracted beams
* Bragg diffraction law: $2d*\sin\theta=n\lambda$
	* When the same beam is reflected by 2 planes, the part which is reflected by the lower plane travels for a longer distance
	* The distance is exactly $2d*sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle of incidence and d is the distance between the planes
	* If this distance is equal to n wavelenghts, we observe reflection because of interference
	* By knowing all the terms except d, I can derive the minimal distance between the diffraction planes
* A typical diffraction maps is organized with 3 coordinates (H, K, L) and an intensity dimension (I)
	* The intesity is proportional to the amplitude, therefore to the amount of costructive interference
	* The 3 coordinates reflect the facts that we are operating in 3 dimensions
	* I can recove the electron densities from the diffraction pattern with the Fourier transform
		* It is a computation-heavy task
* I cannot recover the phase from the diffraction map
	* In a synchrotron, I can recover the phase of the wave with the anisotropy approach
* Once I have the electron density, I need to fit my molecule in it to determin the conformation
	* This is easier if my electron density has an high resolution
	* I can take advantage of similar proteins with a similar structure to do the fitting
	* This fitting procedure is called refinement, because it reduces noise in the model
* To validate my model, I compute the diffraction pattern of the theoretical protein structure to check if it matches the experimental pattern within a reasonable tollerance

## Crio-electron microscopy
* Crio-electron microscopy gives us a diffraction pattern using an electron beam
* It is really useful for really big complexes that cannot be cristallized
* Resolution is lower than X-ray diffraction
* It allowed to obtain the structure of entire ribosomes
* It cannot be used with small proteins that cannot whitstand the electron bombardment
* It is possible to capture the protein in different conformations, and so understand how it works
	* It was used by Rubinstein to obtain a movie of V-ATPase (!)
* It is really costly, around 6000â‚¬/day

# Nuclear magnetic resonance
* It does not require the crystal, it is performed in an homogeneous really concentrated protein solution
* The frequencies used are on the radiowave lenght, so really low energies
* NMR measures contacts among atoms in solution, it measure frequence changes when nuclei come close to each other
* The data produced is a contact map
* The only nuclei considered are mainly O, H, C
* From NMR I get many conformation for each molecule, and if I visualize it in a molecular visualization software I see many superimposed structures
	* The core is usually stable and in agreement with X-ray data, while regions with high temperature factor have many configurations
	* From the many structures I can recover a consensus structure

# Time resolved X-ray crystallography
* I use pulsed X-ray instead of a continuous beam
* I can observe the conformational changes of the protein between different pulses

## PDB and other DBs and tools
* The PDB file does not contain the electron density, it is an approximation of the structure
* The resolution of an X-ray diffraction is important
	* $5.0\AA$ resolution is reasonably accurate only for the position of the backbone
	* $1.5\AA$ can be generally trusted, also for drug design
* A ligand in PDB is any molecule co-cristallized with the macromolecule considered
* Signal peptides are 10 to 30 residues in length
	* They are usually cleaved and therefore they do not appear in the protein 3d strucutre
* A PDB file has an unique identifier of 4 letters and numbers
* On PDB I can also find the FASTA file for the protein
	* FASTA contains the covalent structure (i.e the sequence) of the protein
	* FASTA has 60 residues per line
	* It is the sequence derived from the structure, it can be different than the one in uniprot (!)
* Coverage refers to the percentage of protein sequences covered in the protein structure
* PDB files produced using a synchrotron source have 2 spots associated with every atom
* For each ATOM we have the xyz coordinates, the occupancy, and temperature factor
	* Occupancy is how well the atom fits the electron density
	* The temperature factor refers to the mobility of the position
* The PDB file contains the atomic model of a macromolecule
* The CPK colorscheme is a popular set of colors used for the different atoms
* The structure validation window reports the percentile rank of different validation methods
	* Blue is good, red is bad
* DSSP is a program that reads a PDB file and assigns a secondary structure to each PDB coordinate
	* It was made by Sanders, one of the founders of bioinformatics, and Kabsch
* A database can be defined by its statistics
* Data in a DB can be distributed in categories that are relevant for the interpretation of data
* The space group refers to the simmetries of the unit cell
* The Ramachadran plot of a structure can be generated with Procheck (EMBL)
	* It is much more informative than the 3d view generated with 17Rasmol
* Some PDB statistics
	* 158180 macromolecular structures
	* 76380 enzymes
	* 48974 distinc protein sequences
	* Resolution range from $<1\AA$ to $>4.6\AA$, with a peak around $2\AA$ 
		* Distribution not normal with a long right tail
	* 1702 source organinsms

# PDBsum
* It is a pictorial database that provides an at-a-glance overview of the contents of each 3D structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank
* It is hosted by EMBL-EBI
* It shows also the Procheck/Procheck NMR Ramachadran plot for the structure
* It shows the biological unit instead of the unit cell

# PDB101
* A crystal is composed of the unit cell, that is translationally repeated in the crystal
* The unit cell is composed of asymmetric units, that rotated and translated form the unit cell
* The asymmetric unit is the unique part of the crystal structure
* The biological assembly is the biologically relevant form
* Occupancy of an atom is the fraction of times that atom is in the specified position in the crystal
	* The occupancies for an atom always sum to 1, giving the possible alternate conformations
* The R-value is the fit between the theoretical diffraction pattern of the model and the experimental one
	* 0 is a perfect fit, 0.63 is a the fit of a random diffraction pattern
* R-free is another statistic that avoids the bias introduced in the refinement step

# Ramachadran plot
* $\alpha$ carbons in proteins are $3.8\AA$ apart
* The $\phi$ angle is the dihedral angle between N-C$\alpha$, $\psi$ is between C$\alpha$-COOH
* The Ramachadran plot graphs the $\phi$ angle of a residue against its $\psi$ angle
* Some regions of the plot are really common and allowed, some are not because of steric hindrance
* The Ramachadran plot of a protein is a scatterplot of its dihedral angles superimposed on a color code for the allowed conformational spaces
* Procheck and Procheck NMR calculate Ramachadran plots from PDB files

# Protein structural allignment
* Rigid superimposition requires the knowledge of at least 3 non-allineated equivalent residues, while structural allignment requires no previous knowledge of equivalent positions
* The output of a structural allignment is a set of superimposed 3D coordinates, one for each input structure
* A structural allignment implies a corresponding sequence allignment, from which we can calculate sequence identity and similarity
	* Sequence similarity is meaningful only with an underlying structural similarity
	* Sequence identity is a score between 0 and 1 that gives the number of corresponding residues after the allignment
	* Sequence similarity is a score between 0 and 1 that gives the number of similar residues after the allignment
	* Residues are considered similar if they belong to the same chemical class (polar, non polar, cationic, anionic,...)
	* Structure is conserved more than sequence (!)
* Generally, I keep 1 protein fix as a template, and I try to superimpose the other backbone onto it, allowing the introduction of gaps
* There are many different algorithms to do structural allignment
* The reduce representation of a protein contains only the $C-C\alpha-N$ elements of the backbone
	* Structural allignemnt usually only considers the position of the backbone, so it works on the reduced representation of the protein
* After the allignemnt, it is possible to derive various measures of strucutral similarity
	* The simplest metric is the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) among atomic coordinates
	* The raw score can be normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, so to get the z-score
* One of the most famous structural allignment alogorithms is jCE (Java Combinatorial Extension), written by Philippe Bourne, the director of the PDB
	* It is one of the best-performing algorithms
	* It breaks down the proteins in fragments, and it tries to allign the structure of these by several methods (RMSD, secondary strucutre, ...)
	* It forms a series of alligned fragment pairs (AFPs) and filters them, retaining only those that respect a given measure of local similarity
	* It generates an optimal path among AFPs, that yelds the final allignment
	* The first AFP that nucleates the allignment can occur at any position
	* The size of AFP and the maxium allowed gap are parameters, usually set to heuristic optimal values
	* An important drawback is that It does not deal well with flexible regions that can have different conformations, since it is based on rigid superimpoisitio
* FATCAT is another algorithm that deals better with flexible regions, but can also give spuorios allignments among unrelated regions
* Many algorthms cannot recognize structural similarities that are not sequence order dependent
* Triangle Match deals with sequence order independent relationships
* The lenght of an allignment is the lenght of the protein sequence, plus the gaps introduced
* In the PDB, all possible pairwise structural allignments are pre-calculated and stored in xml files
	* The database is updated weekly
* When alligning structures, it is better to use structures taken with the same method

# Protein structural classification
* A protein family is the set of proteins that perform the same function in different organism, and therefore share a similar structure
* Protein families were discovered by M. Dayhoff
* Multiple structural allignment allows to define protein families
* We know around 14000 protein families
* Multiple allignments are the result of repeated pairwise allignments
* We are doing multiple alignments in order to build a sequence profile
* A sequence profile is a matrix with residues in the y axis and the position in the alignment in the x axis
	* It is a compressed way to describe a consensus sequence
* A protein family is a set of proteins charachterised by structural superimposition
* Protein families are important because they allow us to cluster PDB data
	* They are constructed starting by comparing proteins with the same function
	* It can be then computationally described with structural allignment
	* A protein family is described with an HMM (hidden markow model)
	* Hidden Markow Models are also called Pfam domains
* Proteins in the same family can also be really different in sequence, but their structure is really similar
* We cannot detect sequence similarity when under 30%, but we can detect structure similarity in those cases
	* Under 30% the result of a sequence allignment is not statistically significant
* Pfam categorizes all the entries in the PDB in protein families, clustering for strucutral similarity
	* The Pfam database was built by performing pairwise comparison of all the PDB entries
	* A protein family is described by a Hidden Markow Model (HMM)
* A superfamily is a set of protein families with different foldings that can perform the same function
* A protein domain coincides with the folded protein for small globular proteins (150 aa)
* When the PDB grew, we realised that multi-domain proteins share domains with small globular proteins
* SCOP categorizes proteins in superfamilies, Pfam families and fold
* The SCOP fold can be all alpha, all beta, alpha+beta, alpha/beta, small proteins
	* Alpha+beta has distinct alpha and beta regions
	* Alpha/beta has mixed alpha-beta structures
* Proteins in the same family have clear common evolutionary origin, and usually have >30% sequence identity
* Proteins in the same superfamily have low sequence identity, but common structural and functional features suggest evolutionary relationships
* Proteins are said to have the same fold if they have the same secodary structres in the same arrangement and with the same topology
	* If 2 proteins have the same fold they do not need to be evolutionary related: it can be a case of converging evolution

# Sequence allignment
* It is our only way to compare proteins for which I do not have structures
* A sequence allignment is a continuous stretch of residues of any lenght
* Sequence comparison can be pairwise or database search
* Database search is an extension of pairwise sequence alignment
* Sequence allignment can be local or global
* A global allignment optimizes pairing over the whole sequences by introducing gaps
	* A global allignment has a lenght that is at least as long as the longest sequence
* A local alignment stops the allignment if continuing it makes its score lower
	* From a pairwise comparison, I can get many local allignments
* A metric is a set of rules that allow us to define the distance between strings
* The Hamming distance is, for a pair of sequences equal in lenght, the number of mismatching positions
	* It is used for ungapped allignments
* The Levensthein or edit distance of 2 strings is the minimal number of edits necessary to change 1 string into the other
	* It is suitable for gapped allignments
	* An edit operation is defined as delition, insertion or alteration of a single charachter
* A scoring scheme is a measure of sequence similarity
	* It is a substitution matrix where each possible substitution has a score
	* The matrix is symmetric, so it is often reported only half of it
* Sequence alligment algorthms seek to maximize a scoring function or minimize a dissimilarity measure
* For nucleic acids, there are substitution matrices that only consider match vs mismatch, and matrices that give different scores to transitions and transversions
* For aminoacids, we have the PAM and BLOSUM matrices, and matrices derived from structure allignment
* The PAM matrices were developped by M. Dayhoff and are based on the observed frequencies of mutation of 1 aa into another in alligned proteins of the same family
	* 1 PAM is 1% accept mutation, so 2 sequences 1 PAM apart have 99% sequence identity
	* The matrices were built using closely related sequences 1 PAM apart, so that multiple substitutions were unlikely
* The PAM1 matrix was built by collecting statistics on substitution frequencies in pairwise comparison of sequences 1 PAM apart and correcting for relative aminoacid abundance
	* The score of the mutation i->j is the log-odd of the mutation
	* $S=\log{\frac{p(i,j)}{p(i)*p(j)}}$
	* p(i,j) is the observed i->j mutation rate while p(i) and p(j) are the relative aminoacid abundances
	* Note that p(i)*p(j) is the expected mutation rate if all mutations are equally likely, it is a correction factor for aminoacid frequencies
	* Since the score is a really small number, it is usually multiplied by 10
* Other PAM matrices are built as powers of PAM1
* PAM250 is used for comparing sequences with 20% identity
* Conservation is always positively score, but with different scores depending on aa abundance
* The BLOSUM are a family of matrices that also use the log-odds for the substitutions
	* They were produced in the 1990, where there where many more sequences available
	* They are based on ungapped multiple alignments in short regions of related sequences
	* The different matrices were built using allignments with different thresholds of sequence identity
	* Lower matrices are more permissive since are built with sequences that have less than a treshold of sequence identity
* A dotplot is a plot that gives an overview of the similarity between 2 sequences
	* It is also based on scoring schemes
	* Dotlet is a Java tool for dotplot analisys
	* It is useful for finding repeated portions and for finding intron-exon boundaries
* Dynamic programming optimizes the solution of subproblems in order to find a global solution
	* It gives the correct solution provided that all the subproblems are independent, but it is computationally expensive
* Dynamic programming approaches are Needelman-Wunsch (global) and Smith-Waterman (local)
* Global alligment methods (NW) optimize the allignment over the whole sequence, and can include low-similarity regions
* Local allignment methods (SW) can yeld multiple allignments from a single comparison
	* Low similarity regions do not affect the allignment score
	* Local allignment is preferred in DB searches
* For database searches, we use methods based on words (K-tuples), also called heuristic
	* Heuristic means approximate, it does not give an optimal solution
	* It also means empirical, not based on theory
* BLAST is an heuristic local allignment method used for database search
	* Originally described by Altschull in 1990 in J. Mol. Bio.
	* It is 1 order of magnitude faster than other heuristic methods
* FASTA is another heuristic algorthm but is no longer used
* An heuristic method is optimized for the expected result, therefore it does not have any intrinsic validity
* A heuristic method is not based on theory, while QED is firmly based on theoretical ground
* Whatever is heuristic is at the core data-driven
* In BLAST I chop the query in K-tuples and make a list of words, that I use to scan the DB
	* Word and k-tuples are the same thing
	* A k-tuple is an ordered set of k values
	* At this phase BLAST searches for exact matches of words in the list with DB entries
	* Any of these local alignments can form a maximal segment pair
	* A maximal segment pair (MSP) is defined as the highest scoring pair of identical segments chosen from 2 sequences
		* It can be of any lenght, so to maximize the score
		* It provides a measure of local similarity
	* In biology we care for all conserved regions, not only the best scoring one
		* To take care of this, a segment pair is defined as locally MSP if its score cannot be improved by extending or shortening both segments
	* BLAST filters for all local MSP that score above a cutoff
	* I want to retrive from a database all the sequences with MSP score above a cutoff T
	* The greatest advantage of MSP is that we have the matematical tools to determine its statistical significance
* In BLAST, sequences that score far above the cutoff are almost definitely biologically relevant, while borderline matches can be evalued considering the biological context
* The behaviour of BLAST can be tweaked with some parameters
	* I can search for exact matches or allow for gaps
	* I can choose scoring matrice and gap penalty
* BLAST speeds up DB search by avoiding to spend time in sequences that are unlikely to give high MSP scores
	* Given a fixed word lenght w, BLAST seeks only segment pairs with a word of score at least T
	* When a matche is found, BLAST tries to extend the segment to see if it reaches the desired final cutoff score S
	* The lower the value of T, the more probable that a segment of score >S will contain a word with score >T
	* However, the lower the value of T the higher the number of hits, and therefore the execution time
	* Random simulations allowed to determine an optimal T value for various conditions
* The algorithm first makes a list of words that score >T when compared with some word of the query
	* The time of list generation is linearly proportional to the lenght of the query
* BLAST then tries to extend the MSPs in both directions
* During the extension phase, if the score falls below a certain treshold below the score of the original MSP, it is discarded
	* It loses in accuracy, but in a negligible manner
* Theoretical results on the distribution of MSP scores of random sequences allow the following determiantion
	* Given a set of probabilities for the occurrence of each residue and a scoring matrix
	* The theory gives the parameters $\lambda$ and K for evaluating the statistical significance of MSP scores
	* With 2 random sequences of lenght m and n, the probability of finding an MSP with score equal or better than S is $1-e^{-y}$, with $y = K*m*n*e^{-\lambda S}$
	* In a similar way, we can calculating the probability of having c MSPs with score greater than S
	* This result is the p-value of the MSP score
* A sequence allignment method uses its algorithm and substitution matrices to give a result that maximizes the score of the allignment
* Sequence allignment methods are less stable than structural ones, more sensitive to lenght of the sequences and other variables
* The raw score of a sequence alignment is the sum over its lenght of the score for each match
	* It uses a score substitution matrix to determine the score of each match
	* It can be demonstrated that raw score follows an extreme value distribution
* The bit-score is the Log scaled version of the raw score
	* It is measured in bit, and it is a metric for the search space
	* Each unitary increse in bit score doubles the search space
	* A bit score of 30 means that we expect that score to be observed once in $2^30$ comparisons
	* It is used by BLAST and it uses a formula that is a bit complex
		* $S'=\frac{\lambda S-\ln(K)}{\ln(2)}$
	* The bit-score S' depends on the parameters $\lambda$ and K
	* The 2 parameters depend on the substitution matrix and on the gap penalty, and on the size of query and database
	* It is independent on the size of the search space (dimension of the database), beacuse it corrects for it
* The E-value is a correction of the p-value for multiple testing
	* It is the expected number of matches of that score that I expect in a random database
	* It depends on $K, \lambda$ and the size of the database
* MegaBLAST is an implementation of BLAST optimized for very long and very similar sequences, such as those differing only for sequencing errors
	* It uses a greedy algorithm
* PsiBLAST (position specific iterated)
	* It takes a single protein sequence as input, and compares it to a protein DB with a normal BLAST search
	* Given a threshold, it builts a multiple allignment with all the local allignments above the threshold
	* From the multiple allignment, a profile is built for any local alignment using the query as a base
	* The profile has the same lenght as the query
	* The profile is used again for DB searches using a slight modification of the BLAST algorithm
	* The statistical theory developped for BLAST is also valid in profile searches
	* The algorithm then iterates the process by building another profile from the allignment of the new hits
	* The process is repeated a fixed number of times, or until convergence
