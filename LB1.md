# Introduction
* The reference source in the filed is the Journal of Bioinformatics
* Functional annotation is the core of this course
* Functional annotation studies the relationship between structure and function
* Functional annotation requires data collection, storage and analysis
* Functional annotation is the activity of attributing structural and functional features to translated protein sequences
* Before starting data analysis, be sure of the quality of your data (!)
* A database must be implemented, curated and mined
* Database curation refers to updating the data and to keeping them compliant with the database standard
* A database release is its content at a given date
* Data mining is the retrieval of information from a database
	* It is done with a browser
* In Hamburg there is an EMBL faicility that uses X-rays in a flow citometer

# X-ray cristallography
* I can understand that I have a protein crystal by shining light on it and seeing how it diffracts
* Routinely X-ray diffraction is not able to locate hydrogens
* Each crystal has a unit cell
* Electron density is the result of data analysis on diffraction maps
* The main cristallographic techniques are NMR and X-rays
* X-ray sources used for studying protein structure are synchrotrons or more traditional lab sources
* Synchrotrons are located in the US, Europe or Japan
* Sychrothron source give an anisotrope beam, which gives semicircles in the diffraction map instead of focused spot
* In order to have a diffraction pattern you need to have interference between the diffracted beams
* Bragg diffraction law: $2d*\sin\theta=n\lambda$
	* When the same beam is reflected by 2 planes, the part which is reflected by the lower plane travels for a longer distance
	* The distance is exactly $2d*sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle of incidence and d is the distance between the planes
	* If this distance is equal to n wavelenghts, we observe reflection because of interference
	* By knowing all the terms except d, I can derive the minimal distance between the diffraction planes
* A typical diffraction maps is organized with 3 coordinates (H, K, L) and an intensity dimension (I)
	* The intesity is proportional to the amplitude, therefore to the amount of costructive interference
	* The 3 coordinates reflect the facts that we are operating in 3 dimensions
	* I can recove the electron densities from the diffraction pattern with the Fourier transform
		* It is a computation-heavy task
* I cannot recover the phase from the diffraction map
	* In a synchrotron, I can recover the phase of the wave with the anisotropy approach
* Once I have the electron density, I need to fit my molecule in it to determin the conformation
	* This is easier if my electron density has an high resolution
	* I can take advantage of similar proteins with a similar structure to do the fitting
	* This fitting procedure is called refinement, because it reduces noise in the model
* To validate my model, I compute the diffraction pattern of the theoretical protein structure to check if it matches the experimental pattern within a reasonable tollerance

## Crio-electron microscopy
* Crio-electron microscopy gives us a diffraction pattern using an electron beam
* It is really useful for really big complexes that cannot be cristallized
* Resolution is lower than X-ray diffraction
* It allowed to obtain the structure of entire ribosomes
* It cannot be used with small proteins that cannot whitstand the electron bombardment
* It is possible to capture the protein in different conformations, and so understand how it works
	* It was used by Rubinstein to obtain a movie of V-ATPase (!)
* It is really costly, around 6000â‚¬/day

## PDB and other DBs and tools
* The PDB file does not contain the electron density, it is an approximation of the structure
* The resolution of an X-ray diffraction is important
	* $5.0\AA$ resolution is reasonably accurate only for the position of the backbone
	* $1.5\AA$ can be generally trusted, also for drug design
* A ligand in PDB is any molecule co-cristallized with the macromolecule considered
* Signal peptides are 10 to 30 residues in length
	* They are usually cleaved and therefore they do not appear in the protein 3d strucutre
* A PDB file has an unique identifier of 4 letters and numbers
* On PDB I can also find the FASTA file for the protein
	* FASTA contains the covalent structure (i.e the sequence) of the protein
	* FASTA has 60 residues per line
	* It is the sequence derived from the structure, it can be different than the one in uniprot (!)
* Coverage refers to the percentage of protein sequences covered in the protein structure
* PDB files produced using a synchrotron source have 2 spots associated with every atom
* For each ATOM we have the xyz coordinates, the occupancy, and temperature factor
	* Occupancy is how well the atom fits the electron density
	* The temperature factor refers to the mobility of the position
* The PDB file contains the atomic model of a macromolecule
* The CPK colorscheme is a popular set of colors used for the different atoms
* The structure validation window reports the percentile rank of different validation methods
	* Blue is good, red is bad
* DSSP is a program that reads a PDB file and assigns a secondary structure to each PDB coordinate
	* It was made by Sanders, one of the founders of bioinformatics, and Kabsch
* A database can be defined by its statistics
* Data in a DB can be distributed in categories that are relevant for the interpretation of data
* The space group refers to the simmetries of the unit cell
* The Ramachadran plot of a structure can be generated with Procheck (EMBL)
	* It is much more informative than the 3d view generated with Rasmol
* The PDBsum is a pictorial database that provides an at-a-glance overview of the contents of each 3D structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank
	* It is offered by EMBL
	* It shows also the Procheck output for the structure
	* It shows the biological unit instead of the unit cell

# PDB101
* A crystal is composed of the unit cell, that is translationally repeated in the crystal
* The unit cell is composed of asymmetric units, that rotated and translated form the unit cell
* The asymmetric unit is the unique part of the crystal structure
* The biological assembly is the biologically relevant form
* Occupancy of an atom is the fraction of times that atom is in the specified position in the crystal
	* The occupancies for an atom always sum to 1, giving the possible alternate conformations
* The R-value is the fit between the theoretical diffraction pattern of the model and the experimental one
	* 0 is a perfect fit, 0.63 is a the fit of a random diffraction pattern
* R-free is another statistic that avoids the bias introduced in the refinement step

# Nuclear magnetic resonance
* It does not require the crystal, it is performed in an homogeneous really concentrated protein solution
* The frequencies used are on the radiowave lenght, so really low energies
* NMR measures contacts among atoms in solution, it measure frequence changes when nuclei come close to each other
* The data produced is a contact map
* The only nuclei considered are mainly O, H, C
* From NMR I get many conformation for each molecule, and if I visualize it in a molecular visualization software I see many superimposed structures
	* The core is usually stable and in agreement with X-ray data, while regions with high temperature factor have many configurations
	* From the many structures I can recover a consensus structure

# Time resolved X-ray crystallography
* I use pulsed X-ray instead of a continuous beam
* I can observe the conformational changes of the protein between different pulses

# Protein structure allignment
* We wan to compare the structure of 2 proteins
* Hydrogens bond are mainly located at the level of the backbone
* I keep 1 protein fix as a template, and I try to superimpose the other backbone
	* There are many different algorithms to do this
* The first reasonable step would be to compare the position of the backbone of the 2 proteins
* Sequence similarity is meaningful only with an underlying structural similarity
* The reduce representation of a protein contains only the $C-C\alpha-N$ elements of the backbone
* The simplest measure of structural similarity is the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) among atomic coordinates
* One of the algorthm for strucutural alligment used in the PDB is called java combinatorial extension (JCE)
* JCE was written by Philippe Bourne, the director of the PDB
	* It is one of the best-performing algorithms
	* It breaks down the proteins in fragments, and it tries to allign the structure of these by several methods (RMSD, secondary strucutre, ...)
	* It forms a series of alligned fragment pairs (AFPs) and filters them, retaining only those that respect a given measure of local similarity
	* It generates an optimal path among AFPs, that yelds the final allignment
	* The first AFP that nucleates the allignment can occur at any position
	* The size of AFP and the maxium allowed gap are parameters, usually set to heuristic optimal values
* The lenght of an allignment is the lenght of the protein sequence, plus the gap introduced
* Sequence identity is a score between 0 and 1 that gives the number of corresponding residues after the allignment
* Sequence similarity is a score between 0 and 1 that gives the number of similar residues after the allignment
* Structure is conserved more than sequence (!)

# Protein families
* Multiple structural allignment allow to define protein families
	* We know around 14000 protein families
* They were discovered by M. Dayhoff
* A protein family is the set of proteins that perform the same function in different organism
* Proteins in the same family can also be really different in sequence, but their structure is really similar
* We cannot detect sequence similarity when under 30%, but we can detect structure similarity in those cases
	* Under 30% the result is not statistically significant
* A superfamily is a set of protein families with different foldings that can perform the same function

# Domains
* A protein domain coincides with the folded protein for small globular proteins (150 aa)
* When the PDB grew, we realised that multi-domain proteins share domains with small globular proteins

# Sequence allignment
* It is our only way to compare proteins for which I do not have structures
* Sequence comparison can be pairwise or database search
* Database search is an extension of pairwise sequence alignment
* Sequence allignment can be local or global
* A global allignment optimizes pairing over the whole sequences by introducing gaps
	* A global allignment has a lenght that is at least as long as the longest sequence
* A local alignment stops the allignment if continuing it makes it worse
* A metric is a set of rules that allow us to define the distance between strings
* The Hamming distance is, for a pair of sequences equal in lenght, the number of mismatching positions
	* It is used for ungapped allignments
* The Levensthein or edit distance of 2 strings is the minimal number of edits necessary to change 1 string into the other
	* It is suitable for gapped allignments
* A scoring scheme is a measure of sequence similarity
	* It is a substitution matrix
* Sequence alligment algorthms seek to maximize a scoring function or minimize a dissimilarity measure
* For aminoacids, we have the PAM and BLOSUM matrices, and matrices derived from structure allignment
* 1PAM (Dayhoff) is 1% of accepted mutation
* PAM corrects for the relative abundance of aminoacids
* PAM250 is constructed with sequences of 20% of sequence identity
* Odds are ratios of probabilities
* The log-odds of a mutation can be used as a score
	* It is the log of the probability of the substitution normalized for the frequencies of the residues
	* It is often multiplied by 10 because it is a really small value
* The PAM is a symmetric matrix, therefore sometimes only half is shown
* Conservation is always positively score, but with different scores depending on aa abundance
* The BLOSUM are a family of matrices that also use the log-odds for the substitutions
	* They were produced in the 1990, where there where many more sequences available
	* Lower matrices (es. BLOSUM40) are more permissive
* Dynamic programming optimizes the solution of subproblems in order to find a global solution
	* It gives the correct solution, but it is computationally expensive
* For database searches, we use methods based on words (K-tuples), also called heuristic
	* Heuristic means approximate, it does not give an optimal solution
* Gaps are introduced in order to optimize the number of identities
* Dynamic programming approaches are Needelman-Wunsch (global) and Smith-Waterman (local)
* BLAST is an heuristic local allignment method used for database search
* FASTA is another heuristic algorthm but is no longer used
* An heuristic method is optimized for the expected result, therefore it does not have any intrinsic validity
* In BLAST I chop the query in K-tuples and search for matching K-tuples in the database
	* The K stands for the number of fragments in which I chopped my query
	* I can search for exact matches or allow for gaps
	* Then it tries to extend the match until its score is lower than a threshold
	* Parameters that can be chosed are scoring matrices and gap penalty
* We are doing multiple alignments to build a sequence profile
* A sequence profile is a matrix with residues in the y axis and the position in the alignment in the x axis
	* It is a compressed way to describe a protein family
* A protein family is a set of proteins charachterised by structural superimposition
* Affinity comes from electron densities
* Protein families are important because they allow us to cluster PDB data
	* They are constructed starting by comparing proteins with the same function
	* It can be then computationally describe with structural allignment
	* A protein family is described with an HMM (hidden markow model)
* A heuristic method is not based on theory, while QED is firmly based on theoretical ground
* Whatever is heuristic is at the core data-driven
* A sequence alligment mixes algorthm and substitution matrices to give a result
* Sequence allignment methods are less stable than structural ones, more sensitive to lenght of the sequences and other variables
* Hidden Markow Models are also called Pfam domains
* When alligning structures, it is better to use structures taken with the same method
* The score of an alignment is the sum over its lenght of the score for each match
	* It uses a score substitution matrix to determine the score of each match
* The bit-score is the Log scaled version of the score
	* It is used by BLAST and it uses a formula that is a bit complex
		* $S'=\frac{\lambda S-\ln(K)}{\ln(2)}$
	* The bit-score S' depends on the parameters $\lambda$ and K
	* The 2 parameters depend on the substitution matrix and on the gap penalty
	* It is independent on the size of the search space (dimension of the database)
* The E-value is a correction of the p-value for multiple testing
	* It is the expected number of matches of that score that I expect in a random database
	* It depends on $K, \lambda$ and the size of the database

## BLAST (original paper)
* Originally described by Altschull in 1990 in J. Mol. Bio.
* It is 1 order of magnitude faster than other heuristic methods
* Global alligment methods (NW) optimize the allignment over the whole sequence, and can include low-similarity regions
* Local allignment methods (SW) can yeld multiple allignments from a single comparison
	* Low similarity regions do not affect the allignment score
	* Local allignment is preferred in DB searches
* Many similarities methods start with a substitution matrix
	* It used PAM120 for proteins and a -5 identity -4 mismatch matrix for DNA
* A sequence allignment is a continuous stretch of residues of any lenght
* The similarity score of an allignment is the sum of similarity values for each pair of alligned residues
* A maximal segment pair (MSP) is defined as the highest scoring pair of identical segments chosen from 2 sequences
	* It can be of any lenght, so to maximize the score
	* It provides a measure of local similarity
* Since in biology we care for all conserved regions, not only the best scoring one
	* Therefore a segment pair id defined as locally MSP if its score cannot be improved by extending or shortening both segments
* BLAST seeks all local MSP that score above a cutoff
* The greatest advantage of MSP is that we have the matematical tools to determine its statistical significance
* I want to retrive from a database all the sequences with MSP score above a cutoff S
	* Sequences that score far above the cutoff are almost definitely biologically relevant, while borderline matches can be evalued considering the biological context
* BLAST speeds up DB search by avoiding to spend time in sequences that are unlikely to give high MSP scores
	* Given a fixed word lenght w, BLAST seeks only segment pairs with a word of score at least T
	* When a matche is found, BLAST tries to extend the segment to see if it reaches the desired final cutoff score S
	* The lower the value of T, the more probable that a segment of score >S will contain a word with score >T
	* However, the lower the value of T the higher the number of hits, and therefore the execution time
	* Random simulations allowed to determine an optimal T value for various conditions
* The algorithm first makes a list of words that score >T when compared with some word of the query
	* The time of list generation is linearly proportional to the lenght of the query
* During the extension phase, if the score falls below a certain treshold lower than the original MSP, it is discarded
	* It loses in accuracy, but in a negligible manner
* Theoretical results on the distribution of MSP scores of random sequences allow the following determiantion
	* Given a set of probabilities for the occurrence of each residue and a scoring matrix
	* The theory gives the parameters $\lambda$ and K for evaluating the statistical significance of MSP scores
	* With 2 random sequences of lenght m and n, the probability of finding an MSP with score equal or better than S is $1-e^{-y}$, with $y = K*m*n*e^{-\lambda S}$
	* In a similar way, we can calculating the probability of having c MSPs with score greater than S
	* This result is the p-value of the MSP score
