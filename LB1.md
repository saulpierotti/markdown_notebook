# Course organization
* Lab1 in the first (Lab1a) and second semester are actually separate courses
* In february there is a 1 week intensive course run by professor Allegravia, which is part of Lab1a
	* It is about protein-protein interaction
	* We will have an exam also for this part
* There will be a written test on 09/01/20
* We have to write a report for 10/01/20 or 22/01/20
	* If we submit for the first deadline we will have feedback
* The oral defence will be in the last week of January
	* Probably it will be 29-31/01/20

# Introduction
* The reference source in the filed is the Journal of Bioinformatics
* Functional annotation studies the relationship between structure and function
* Functional annotation requires data collection, storage and analysis
* Functional annotation is the activity of attributing structural and functional features to translated protein sequences
* Before starting data analysis, be sure of the quality of your data (!)
* A database must be implemented, curated and mined
* Database curation refers to updating the data and to keeping them compliant with the database standard
* A database release is its content at a given date
* Data mining is the retrieval of information from a database
	* It is done with a browser

# Protein cristallography
* I can understand that I have a protein crystal by shining light on it and seeing how it diffracts
* Routinely X-ray diffraction is not able to locate hydrogens
* Each crystal has a unit cell
* Electron density is the result of data analysis on diffraction maps
* The main cristallographic techniques are NMR and X-rays
* X-ray sources used for studying protein structure are synchrotrons or more traditional lab sources
* Synchrotrons are located in the US, Europe or Japan
* Sychrothron source give an anisotrope beam, which gives semicircles in the diffraction map instead of focused spot
* In order to have a diffraction pattern you need to have interference between the diffracted beams
* Bragg diffraction law: $2d*\sin\theta=n\lambda$
	* When the same beam is reflected by 2 planes, the part which is reflected by the lower plane travels for a longer distance
	* The distance is exactly $2d*sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle of incidence and d is the distance between the planes
	* If this distance is equal to n wavelenghts, we observe reflection because of interference
	* By knowing all the terms except d, I can derive the minimal distance between the diffraction planes
* A typical diffraction maps is organized with 3 coordinates (H, K, L) and an intensity dimension (I)
	* The intesity is proportional to the amplitude, therefore to the amount of costructive interference
	* The 3 coordinates reflect the facts that we are operating in 3 dimensions
	* I can recove the electron densities from the diffraction pattern with the Fourier transform
		* It is a computation-heavy task
* I cannot recover the phase from the diffraction map
	* In a synchrotron, I can recover the phase of the wave with the anisotropy approach
* Once I have the electron density, I need to fit my molecule in it to determin the conformation
	* This is easier if my electron density has an high resolution
	* I can take advantage of similar proteins with a similar structure to do the fitting
	* This fitting procedure is called refinement, because it reduces noise in the model
* To validate my model, I compute the diffraction pattern of the theoretical protein structure to check if it matches the experimental pattern within a reasonable tollerance

## Crio-eletron microscopy
* Crio-electron microscopy gives us a diffraction pattern using an electron beam
	* It is really useful for really big complexes that cannot be cristallized
	* Resolution is lower than X-ray diffraction

## PDB
* The PDB file does not contain the electron density, it is an approximation of the structure
* The resolution of an X-ray diffraction is important
	* $5.0\AA$ resolution is reasonably accurate only for the position of the backbone
	* $1.5\AA$ can be generally trusted, also for drug design
* A ligand in PDB is any molecule co-cristallized with the macromolecule considered
* Signal peptides are 10 to 30 residues in length
	* They are usually cleaved and therefore they do not appear in the protein 3d strucutre
* A PDB file has an unique identifier of 4 letters and numbers
* On PDB I can also find the FASTA file for the protein
	* FASTA contains the covalent structure (i.e the sequence) of the protein
	* FASTA has 60 residues per line
	* It is the sequence derived from the structure, it can be different than the one in uniprot (!)
* Coverage refers to the percentage of protein sequences covered in the protein structure
* PDB files produced using a synchrotron source have 2 spots associated with every atom
* For each ATOM we have the xyz coordinates, the occupancy, and temperature factor
	* Occupancy is how well the atom fits the electron density
	* The temperature factor refers to the mobility of the position
* The PDB file contains the atomic model of a macromolecule
* The CPK colorscheme is a popular set of colors used for the different atoms
* The structure validation window reports the percentile rank of different validation methods
	* Blue is good, red is bad
* DSSP is a program that reads a PDB file and assigns a secondary structure to each PDB coordinate
	* It was made by Sanders, one of the founders of bioinformatics, and Kabsch
