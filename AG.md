# Course structure
* Population genetics
* Genome structure and variability in vertebrates (we may mention plants and bacteria)
* High throughput genomic platforms
* Applications of NGS
* Array comparative genome hybridization 
* PLINK, genetic data analysis. How to use this software and apply some design using this tool
* Linkage analysis and genetic mapping
* QTL analysis

# Examination mode
* Final exam has 2 levels
	* Preparation of a genomic project
		* A text should be written including an appropriate introduction to the problem/question that the experiment or project would like to analyse or answer, aim of the project, a section with materials and methods, expected results and impact
		* The project should be submitted to the professor one week before the interview
		* We should specify What is the aim of the project and what I’d like to solve with it
			* If it makes sense, we can undergo a discussion with him
		* The project is based on money: we’ll have a budget
	* Interview based on the project submitted and other two questions
		* Only students that are positively evaluated at the first level are admitted at the second level
		* Evaluation of basic knowledge
* We get one extra point if we pass at the first attempt
* It is important to follow him
* We’ll have an example of a project, the topic of the project it’s up to us
* We need to choose a complex genome/organism
* Each one will have a different budget
* It’s better to do the project according to what we discuss in the lectures
* It has to be something new
* The first date would be in February after Winter School and another one in March
* Near to the end of the course we’ll have a test with 30 questions to test our level (it won’t count for the final score)

# Introduction
* Genomics is the study of genome structure and function
* The genome is the entire genetic content of an organism
* Applied genomics is the use of technologies, tools and experimental designs to analyse genome and extract information form them
* A reference genome of a species is the basis used for analyzing the genome of an individual
* We have about 2 nuclear genomes per cell, but even thousands of mithocondrial genomes
* Mithocondrial genomes can be not all equal: heteroplasmy
* The human nuclear genome is around 3 Gb, the mithocondrial genome 16.7 Kb
* Population genetics is important for this course
* Small population are susceptible to high levels of inbreeding
* Differences between population arise when there are reproductive barriers
* Effective population size is the number of individual that originated a population
	* It is a measure of inbreeding
* Sex determination can be mediate by sex chromosomes, temperature, ploidy
* Phenotype is influenced by the environment
* A phenotype is an observable charachteristic
* Comparative genomics is the study of genomic differences between species
	* It is really helpful for genome annotation
* The first draft of the human genome was completed in 2001, and the HGP was started in 1990, and the HGP was started in 1990
* 3% of human DNA is coding
* Repetitive sequences are problematic for assembling genomes
* Nuclear DNA is 99.99% identical among individuals, while mitochondrial genome is more similar
* The simplest definition of gene is "coding region"
* We can predict the phenotype of an animal just looking at the genotype (!)
