# Introduction
* Genomics is the study of genome structure and function
* The genome is the entire genetic content of an organism
* Applied genomics is the use of technologies, tools and experimental designs to analyse genome and extract information form them
* Genetics studies differences: we cannot track things that are not different among individuals
* A reference genome of a species is the basis used for analyzing the genome of an individual
	* In some cases if I do not have a reference genome I can use that of a similar species
* We have about 2 nuclear genomes per cell, but even thousands of mithocondrial genomes
* Mithocondrial genomes can be not all equal: heteroplasmy
* The human nuclear genome is around 3 Gb, the mithocondrial genome 16.7 Kb
* Population genetics is important for this course
* Small population are susceptible to high levels of inbreeding
* Differences between population arise when there are reproductive barriers
* Effective population size is the number of individual that originated a population
	* It is a measure of inbreeding
* Sex determination can be mediate by sex chromosomes, temperature, ploidy
* Phenotype is influenced by the environment
* A phenotype is an observable charachteristic
* Comparative genomics is the study of genomic differences between species
	* It is really helpful for genome annotation
* The first draft of the human genome was completed in 2001, and the HGP was started in 1990
* 3% of human DNA is coding
* Repetitive sequences are problematic for assembling genomes
* Nuclear DNA is 99.99% identical among individuals, while mitochondrial genome is more similar
* The simplest definition of gene is "coding region"
* We can predict the phenotype of an animal just looking at the genotype (!)
* To do applied genomics I need a reference genome
* If I do not have a reference genome for my species of interest, I need to construct it or I can use one of a closely-related species
* Genomics produces around 10 Zb of data per year
	* We cannot store everithing: we must select what is worth storing and what is not
	* It is interesting to look at portions that differ from the reference genome
* The cost of sequencing is dropping in a way similar to Moore's law
	* Around 2008 the drop was much faster than Moore's law, thanks to NGS
* The shotgun approach does not have a particular target, it sequences everything
* Genomic data are typically stored in the cloud
* Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
	* $\begin{cases}p^2+q^2+2pq=f(AA)+f(Aa)+f(aa)=(p+q)^2=1 \\ p+q=1\end{cases}$
	* The allele frequencies refer to the current generation, while the genotype frequencies refer to the next generation
	* It holds in absence of genetic drift, non-random mating, selection, migration, mutation
* Mendel's first law: alleles segregate with other alleles
* Mendel's second law: independent assortment
* Mendel's third law: some alleles are dominant on others
* We reviewed PCR, agarose gel electrophoresys and Sanger sequencing basics
* Reference genomes can be found in the Ensemble database
* Penetrance is the proportion of individual with a given genotype that manifest the associated phenotype

# Genome structure and variability in vertebrates

# Sanger sequencing
* Sanger sequencing was developped by F. Sanger in 1977
* It uses DNA polymerase to extend a primer using genomic DNA as a template
* ddNTPs are incorporated in the reaction mixture in a controlled ratio
	* ddNTPs lack a 3'-OH and thus cannot be used for extending the DNA chain
	* The ration ddNTP/dNTP is typically around 1/100, but it depends on the lenght of the desired sequence
	* When a ddNTP is incorporated the extension reaction is interrupted
* In the original Sanger publication and in the first approaches radioactive labels were used
	* Either the primers were labeled, or a single dNTP (not ddNTP!) in the mixture
	* 4 different reaction were performed and separately processed, each with a single ddNTP type
* In the current approach, dye-terminator sequencing, the 4 different ddNTPs are labeled with different fluorophores
	* The strand itself and the primers are not labeled
	* A single reaction is done with all the 4 labeled ddNTPs and run together on the capillary gel
* The ssDNA fragments are run in a capillary electrophoretic apparatus
	* ssDNA hairpins are a serious probelm for lenght resolution
	* A denaturing polyacrilamide-urea gel is used
* In dye-terminator sequencing an electropherogram is produced, showing fluorescent intensity peaks for each of the 4 channels
* Sanger sequencing primers are designed according to the region that I want to sequence
	* In general I use Sanger when I have a reference!

# Next generation sequencing
* NGS platforms: Illumina, Ion torrent (Thermo fisher), PacBio, Nanopore, 454
	* PacBio was going to be acquired by Illumina, but the antitrust opposed and the merger was canceled
	* We have short reads, therefore assembly is difficult
	* 454 (La Roche, pirosequencing) is practically dead today
* The depth of coverage is the number of unique reads that contain a specifc nucleotide in the assembly
* Sequencing a mammalian genome at 50x costs around 2000â‚¬+VAT in China or South Korea
	* BGI (Bejing genome institute) is the largest sequencing provider and it is chinese
	* NOVOGENE is from South Korea
	* If I chose to use these services, I need to consider shipping restrictions, costs, and product degradation
* In sequencing, if we are not sure about a variant we exclude it
* When I do genotyping by sequencing, the regions of interest have a very high depth of coverage so I can trust the results
* We have tools for allignment of reads to a reference like bowtie
	* They produce a BAM file
* There are tools for calling mutations, Indels, ecc.
* Fastq is similar to fasta but it has additional information on it
	* It uses ASCII symbols to code a quality score (PHRED score, from the homonimous software) in a separate line from the one where the bases are stored
		* PHRED uses hard-code lookup tables of peak charachteristics to estimate quality
	* The highest quality is 93 for fastq
	* The quality score is the ASCII code of the charachter (!)
		* ASCII 33 to 126 are used, encoding scores from 0 to 93
	* The quality score rarely exceeds 60 in raw data, but can be higher in assemblies
	* The threshold quality score now accepted for base calling is 30
* Illumina reads file looks like a fastq, but quality scores have a different scale
	* If my file has scores higher than 90, it is an Illumina file
* Allignments are saved in .sam format, a tab-delimited text file that can be converted in a binary .bam file
	* The sam file contains the sequence of reads, their genomic alignment coordinate, contig, mate read name
	* samtools is used for working with sam files
* Sequencers are actually high-performance PCs with Intel Xeon CPUs and 48 Gb of RAM!
* The NGS platforms that are not portable are so because the optics cannot be miniaturized

## Ion torrent
* There are many sequencing chips, with different throughputs
* The sequencing device is a semiconductor chip with millions of nano-wells
	* Each well is represented as a pixel
* DNA fragments are clonally amplified on acrylamide beads that are poured on the chip and go in the wells, one for each well
* The chip is sequentially flodded with the 4 nucleotides, allowing a stepwise progression of DNA synthesis
* The addition of a nucleotide releases a proton, changing the pH of the well
* The drop in pH is recorded as a base call for the well
* I have clonal amplification on positively charged spheres
* During the addition of a nucleotide, a proton is released
* If I add nucleotides one at a time, I can sense the pH change due to the many protons released by the clones
* If I have multiple nucleotides of the same type in a row, I get a stronger signal
* Regions with a stretch of the same nucleotide are called omopolymeric
	* It is difficult to exactly count the number of nucleotides in these regions
* The raw data produced is called ionogram
* We use universal adapters with a specific portion to amplify the DNA fragments
* The machine is called ion or proton torrent
* In the preparation step we obtain thousands of template molecules
* The first step of the workflow is library preparation
* Library preparation depends on the kind of samples
* I can sequence amplicons, genomes, RNA libraries
* I can only sequence small fragments: I need a fragmentation step
* Fragmentation can be done by sonication or with aspecific DNases
* Playing with the time of fragmentation, I can modulate the length of the fragments
* Frequently I need to try in different ways (!)
* It is a random process!
* I have to amplify all my fragments by PCR
* It will take forever with standard PCR, so I do emulsion PCR where every drop harbours a reaction
* I then do an electrophoresis to get only the fragments of a certain size
* NGS can typically sequence from 25 up to 400 nucleotides, but the highest throughput is around 100 BP per read
* The ideal case is that in a droplet I have a bead and a single DNA fragment
* The DNA attached to the acrylamide beads after emulsion PCR is retrieved with the ion sphere particle enhancement technique
	* I use magnetic beads with streptavidin to capture the amplified acrylamide beads
	* The beads bind biotin-labeled nucleotides on the beads, so this will select only sucessfully amplified beads
	* After magnetic pull I denature the streptavidin and release the acrylamide template beads
* To increase my output, I can regolate my flow (nucleotides added) considering gc content of my target
	* One flow is the addition of 1 nucleotide to the chip
* The real throughput of my sequencing system is lower than the theoretical one
	* If 2 different fragments are amplified together I get mixed reads, and they give me false sequences as output
	* I need to ignore the mixed reads, but they will waste some of my sequencing wells
	* The same for 2 beads with the same fragment: duplicate reads
* The ionogram is expected to show on average a peak every 4 flows
	* If I see too many peaks close to each other, I probably have mixed reads
* I have a reference sequence known, and if this sequence reaches a threshold signal I keep my read, otherwise I discard it
* In missed reads I have too many empty spaces in each read, more than statistically reasonable
* Ion torrent reads are longer than Illumina, around 400 bp, and it runs in a shorter time (2 to 7 hours)
* A single run produces 50 Mb to 15 Gb raw
* Ion torrent is now specialising in clinical applications with the PGM machine
* Usually it does not support paired-end sequencing, but the PGM sequencer does

## Roche 454
* It works in similar way to Ion Torrent, but it senses the release of pyrophosphate during elongation
	* NUcleotides are added in flows like for ion torrent
	* PPi and adenylil-sulfate are converted to ATP and sulfate by sulfurylase (Sulfate adenylyltransferase)
	* ATP is used by luciferase releasing a photon
	* APyrase continously removes excess NTPs that are not incorporated
* It was the first NGS to be developped, but also the first one to become obsolete
* Like Ion Torrent, it uses beads on a chip and the target is amplified by emulsion PCR
* $PP_i$ is used by sulphurylase to synthetize ATP, ATP is used by luciferase to produce light
* Light emission is sensed by a CCD camera producing a pyrogram
* This technique was abandoned because it is too expensive
	* The cost is mainly due to the many enzymes used (sulphurylase, luciferase, apyrase)
	* The CCD camera is expensive
* It has revolutionized bacterial taxonomy because it allowed to sequence the rRNA 16s
	* This is because it can produce longer reads than other NGS techniques
* It can produce 500 Mb per run with a read lenght of 400-600 bp

# Illumina
* Library preparation
	* DNA is fragmented by sonication
	* Overhangs are blunted or repaired
		* I use T4 polymerase and Klenow fragment for repair and blunting
		* Polymerase activity fills the 5' overhangs and exonuclease activity removes the 3' overhangs
	* All the 5' ends are poshporylated, since their status is unknown after sonication
		* I use T4 PNK
	* A single A is added at the 3' of the fragments to avoid ligation of different fragments in the blunt ligation step
		* Adapter on the contrary have a single T 3' overhang to facilitate ligation with the fragments
	* Adapters are ligated to fragments with ligase
	* PCR is used for selectively amplifying fragments that have been correctly ligated to adapters
		* The primers anneal to the end of the adapter and have a tail that adds sequences used for the library amplification in the flowcell
* In a flowcell, I have many oligos that can anneal with the inserted sequences at the end of the adapters
* Bridge amplification amplifyes the fragments in the flowcell
* After bridge-amplification, I get clonal clusters of fragments
* In the elongation step I add all the nucleotides together, marked with fluorophores and reversibly inhibited at their 3'
	* These modified nucleotides are called reversible dye terminator chemistry
	* The primers used anneal to the adapter that is not part of the flowcell
* The elongation is stepwise because there is a block in 3' that inhibits elongation
	* I can easily deal with homoplimeric regions (!)
	* Because of this the error rate is much lower
* After nucleotide incorporation I excite the flowcell with laser and capture the resulting fluorescence with a CCD camera
* An enzimatic step that cleaves the 3' block and the fluorophore
* I can sequence both ends of my fragments, and this is really useful for the assembly step
	* I can play with fragment size to obtain my contigs
* When I sequence a genome, I need to consider sequencing depth and coverage
	* Sequencing depth is the average number of times that a nucleotide in my reference genome is represented in a read
* In order to reduce cost, I can run more samples in the same lane by using a barcode attached to my fragments
* MySeq can be used for metagenomics (16S sequencing, 24 samples per lane) and for microbial WGS
	* It can procduce 3-7 million reads per lane
* HiSeq can be used for WGS (3-4 lanes per genome) and exome capture (4 samples per lane)
	* It can procduce 100-160 million reads per lane

## AB SOLiD
* It is dead by now, but could be potentially great because it gives the highest throughput
* Its reads are really short (30 bp) so it is computationally heavy to asseble the reads and it is impossible to use with repetitive regions
* It is based on sequencing by oligo ligation detection
* DNA is fragmented and ligated to P1 and P2 adapters
	* I can prepare simple or mate-paired libraries
	* Mate-paired libraries use also an internal adapter
* A clonal population of beads is created from the fragments by emulsion PCR
* Beads are covalently attached to a glass slide
* The slide is incubated with an universal sequencing primer, di-base probes and DNA ligase
* The primer has its 5'P oriented towards the fragment (away from the bead)
* There are 16 (all the possible $4^2$ 2-mers) different dibase probes, marked with 4 different fluorophores
	* Each dye could correspond to 4 of the 16 di-base probes
	* The probes have the di-base specific sequence at the 3' and 6 additional aspecific positions at their 5'
* The fluorescent signal is acquired
* 3 bases at the 5' of the probes are cleaved, removing the dye
* Phosphatase is also used so to cap eventual unextended fragments
* The step is repeated until needed by ligating another di-base probe at the 5' of the previous one
* Since each probe is 8 nucleotides long but 3 nucleotides are cleaved, the system interrogates 2 bases every 5 (2 interrogated and 3 no, then 2 interrogated and so on)
* Everithing melted and repeated with different primers that have an offset of -1, -2 , -3, and -4 bases
	* In this way I get a reading for the missing positions
	* I get 2 reads from 2 different probes at each position
* There is an unique conbination of bases that can give the combination of reads, so I can reconstruct the original sequence
	* Each ordered combination of colors corresponds to a base
* It can produce more than 100 Gb per run!
* Unfortunately read lenght is around 50-100 bp

## Complete genomics
* It is used for re-sequencing common genomes
* Fragments are made circular and then amplified by rolling circle amplification, obtaining DNA nanoballs (DNBs)
* DNBTMs are around 200 nm in size
* They are anchored in a chip obtained by photolitography
* The chip is made so to have a grid pattern of sticky spots
	* A sticky spot is just a small well in the surface of the chip
* Each sticky spot recives exactly one nanoball, thanks to proprietary technology
* Sequencing is done by combinatorial probe-anchor ligation (cPAL)
* The DNB contains genomic DNA and an initial adapter sequence
* 1 of 4 labeled anchor probes made of a specific position and 8 aspecific positions binds to the adapter and it is ligated with ligase (similar to AB SOLiD)
* Complete genomics was acquired by BGI and it does not sell sequencing equipment
* You send samples to them and they produce data in ~100 days

## PacBio
* It is really a promising technology
* Reads are long, up to a 6-10 kb, but troughput is low
* The long reads make assembly easy and don't require really high depth of coverage
* The error rate is quite high (15%), and probably it cannot be reduced under 5%
* It is costly, 40kâ‚¬ for 10x in mammalian genomes
* It does not require amplification, so no bias is introduced
* It is a golden standard for new sequencing projects, usually matched with Illumina
	* Assembling PacBio reads can be difficult due to the high error rate
	* Single Illumina reads are around 1% error, so assembling Illumina reads to PacBio reads is much easier
	* I can use PacBio to resolve repetitive regions and difficult-to-amplify regions, and Illumina for depth of coverage and accuracy
* PacBio was going to be bought by Illumina, but the anti-trust opposed it and themerger was canceled
* It is based on Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) Sequencing
* Hairpin adapters are ligated to both ends of dsDNA, so to create a circular molecule
* A sequencing primer and DNA polymerase are added and bind the DNA molecules, but do not extend it since nucleotides are not added
* The DNA fragments with bound primer and polymerase are inserted in a SMRT cell
* The SMRT cell contains millions of wells on its surface, called Zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs)
* Each ZMW hosts a single DNA molecule with a single DNA polymerase and primer
* The DNA polymerase is fixed at the botton of the ZMW, making the single-molecule signal detectable
* Labeled nucleotides are added and their addition is detected in each ZMW
	* The systhesis is continuous, not stepwise like in Illumina
	* Detection is possible since the nucleotide pauses for some time at the bottom of the ZMW while it is added
	* AFter addition the dye is cleaved and diffuses away
* 2 modes of operation are possible: Circular consensus Sequencing (CCS) and Continuous Long Reads (CLR)
* In CCS the circular DNA is read again and again generating an high-fidelity (HiFi) read, with 99% accuracy
* In CLR the molecule is as long as possible and it is read for as many nucleotides as possible, so to generate long reads
* It is teoretically possible to detect modified bases with PacBio but this is not still done in practice
	* Modified bases tend to spend more time in the polymerase

## Oxford nanopore
* Long reads, but high error rate and low thorughput
* The reads can potentially be very long, up to 100kb depending on library preparation
* Libraries are prepared with double strand fragments in which are joined at one end by an hairpin adaptor
* DNA passes trough a modified hemolysine pore altering the ion flow thorugh the pore
	* The pore is around 1 nm in diameter (half the widdht of DNA!)
* A motor protein pre-loaded on an adapter oligo regulates the speed at which DNA moves through the pore and acts as an helicase
* After all the molecule has passed through the pore, since the adaptor is an hairpin the reverse strand is sequenced
	* In this way I have 2 reads per fragment
* Many DNA molecule pass in parallel through many nanopores (around 500 in MinION, 2000 in GridION) placed on a membrane
* Each nanopore has its own sensor and it is placed in a nanowell
* Bases are read in 4-mers and then the signal of subsequent reads is interpolated by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Interpretation of the raw data is difficult, because the meaning of reads depends on the sequence context
	* Error rate is around 4%
	* I can recognise not only ATCG, but also U, 5mC, and other modified bases
	* Machine learning!
* The platform is cheap (~5000â‚¬, sometimes given for free) but adapters and accessories are expensive
* It is invaluable when I have to work on-site, since it is small and portable
* MinION can produce 150 Mb per run with 48kb reads
* Oxford Nanopore can be used not only for sequencing, but also for detecting protein-DNA interactions, small molecules

## Other NGS techniques
* Intelligent BioSystems Mini20 is a sequencing by synthesis platform designed for clinical use
	* It has 100 nt long reads, but it is expected to be able to compete with Sanger sequencing
	* It is sensitive to repeats
	* Full costs are still not clear, but the instrument costs 120k \$ and the disposable flow cell 150 \$
* Genia Technologies is an early stage announcment for a system that should combine Ion Torrent and Oxford Nanopore
	* It claims a sensitivity 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than Oxford Nanopore, with as many as 100k pores per chip, with as many as 100k pores per chip
	* Planned sample cost less than 100 \$

# Applications of NGS
* A genome assembly can be done in chromosomes or in scaffolds
* Scaffolds are assembled from contigs
* Sometimes it is not possible to assemble entire chromosomes
* The quality score of an assembly (n50) is the minimum size of scaffolds that contain 50% of the assembled genome
* A human chromosome is on average 80-100 Mb
* ChiPseq (chromatine immunoprecipitation) is a method used to analyse DNA-protein interactions
	* The output is a library of sequences that bind the protein of interest
	* The first step is to fix the proteins with DNA using formaldehyde
	* Subsequently, cells are lised and DNA fragmented
	* The sequences of interest are recovered with Ab against the protein of interest
	* I reverse the DNA-protein binding and sequence the fragments 
* If I want to reduce cost, I can sequence only the exome
	* The exome is around 1% of the genome in humans!
	* In order to sequence the exome I need a capturing system
	* If not commercially available I have to evaluate if developping a capturing system is worth it 
	* In order to enrich for the exome, I need to have specific probes that bind to exon regions, either in solution (on beads) or in microarrays
	* Probes are typically obtained from cDNA
* If I do not have enough money to sequence every individual, I can pool DNA samples in group (i.e. breed) and do a sequencing for each group
* A reduced representation library is obtained by digestion of the genome
	* I run the digest on agarose and retrieve only a specific subset of MW
	* If I see definite bands in the gel, these probably come from repeated regions that are cut at the same lenght
		* I want to exclude this (!)
	* In the digestion, I can choose a restriction enzyme with a long target sequence if I want longer fragments (cut site less probable!) and vice versa
* RNA-seq is an NGS application used for revealing the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment
	* It can be used to asses alternative splicing events, post-trascriptional modifications
	* It can be used to identify exon-intron boundaries
	* In general, RNA is isolated and eventually enriched for the species of interest (mRNA, tRNA, ...)
		* rRNA usually needs to be depleted since it represent 90% of the total rRNA content
	* cDNA is synthesised from the RNA library, fragmented and size-selected
		* Biases can be introduced at this step
		* Direct RNA sequencing has been tried by several companies
* NGS has several applications in cancer research
	* It can be used for detecting not only SNPs but also large indels, by looking at differential depth of coverage
	* I can detect cromosomal translocation by looking for reads that span 2 chromosomes
	* I can detect viruses and aother pathogen's genomes
* A CNV is a 1 kb or longer DNA segment present at variable copy number
* They can be discovered by analizing the depth of coverage of the region
	* This does not tell me in which allele the copies are (!)
* Array competitive genomic hybridization (aCGH) was once a golden standard for CNVs, now it is not
	* It is used for the identification of tumors
	* It is performed on a DNA microarray
	* Single probes are 50-75 nucleotides long and they are syntetized
		* They are selected so to be spaced around 20 kb apart and to have a specific GC content
		* I need to have a certain GC content so to be able to do the annealing step for all the microarray at the same temperature
		* I do not want probes on repeated sequences
	* I do the hybridization with a reference DNA and the sample mixed and marked with different fluorophores
	* I measure the log_2 of the ratio of the intensities in order to call CNVs
		* 0 means that I have the same number of copies, 1 that I have the double number of copies
	* If I want to decrease the noise I can decide to call only more than 5 (es) sequential calls at the same level
		* In this way I loose resolution (!)
	* Note that if I compare the X chromosome in males and females, I get double the reads in females (!)
	* It is a good complement for cytogenetics
* High density SNP arrays are the most common method used for CNV detection
	* CNV alters the signal intesity of certain probes due to the differential amount of DNA present
	* I can also detect a concerted pattern of intensity alteration in neighboring SNPs
	* Various algorithms are availabe for calling CNVs from SNP array data
* ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) uses a transposase to generate fragments in open chromatine regions, outside of nucleosomes
* Bisulphite sequencing is used to detect methylated regions by converting C but not 5mC to T with bisulphite

# Plink
* A pedigree is a standardised representation of individuals in a population and relationships among them
	* It can be represented in plane text or in binary form
* Plink is an important tool for working with reference genomes
	* It can work with text files (`--file` parameter, without extension for homonimous .ped and .map files)
	* It can work with binaries (`--bfile` option)
* PED and MAP file work in pairs: I typically have my_file.ped and my_file.map with the same root name and referring to the same data
* The PED (pedigree) file is a text file with a row for each individual
	* It stores the pedigree of the population
	* This format is standard and it is used by different tools
	* It is Tab-separated and there are fields for the father, mother, sex, family, phenotype, SNPs
	* Missing data are usually reported with 0
* The MAP (map on the genome) file is a text file that has a line for each SNP
	* It reports chromosome number, SNP ID, position, distance from other SNPs
	* It is produced processing the raw output of a genotyping platform
* A polymorphism is such if it has a frequency higher than 1%
* Before doing data analysis, check your data (!)
	* I want to exclude faulty individuals and faulty loci
	* Plink can filter out data at a given threshold
	* I want to exclude low-frequency alleles: my focus is the population, not the individual
	* I can exclude SNPs that violate the HW equilibrium
	* I can exclude mendelian errors: genotypes that are impossible given the parents
* Basic usage
	* `--freq` gives the frequency of a SNP
	* If I don't trust the data provider about the sexes, I can check for absolute homozigosity at X loci: in this case I have a male
	* I can want to filter out duplicates due to sampling errors
	* If I am working with non-human or I have partially assembled scaffolds, I need to specify `--allow-extra-chromosomes` or the species, if available in plink (es. `--sheep`)
	* `--out` specifies the root filename of the output
	* `--noweb` is usually required otherwise it checks forever for updates

# Genome assembly
* The human genome is repeat rich
* The main approaches are whole genome shotgun and hierarchical shotgun approach (BAC based)
* Hierarchical shotgun allows to resolve repetitive regions by building bigger contigs (!)
* At the time of the first human genome, sequencing was expensive so we could not sequence BACs and then assemble them, we needed to select non-duplicate BACs beforehand
* I start from a gene in a known position in a chromosome, and check which BACs contain it by PCR
	* This links my assembly to the physical chromosome
* Genetic maps are linkage maps, and they can be used for assembling genomes
* Physical maps refer to the position of a gene in the chromosome
* A strategy to select overlapping BACs is to digest them with restriction enzymes and search for common fragments among different BACs
* The main problems of hierarchical shotgun are that it is slow and assembly is problematic if some BACs contain chimeric DNA
	* Chimeric DNA is a fragment that is created by the association of fragments from different chromosomes during the construction of the library
* The alternative to hierarchical shotgun is whole genome shotgun
* N50 is a statistics that defines assembly quality in terms of contiguity
	* It is the lenght of the sorterst contig that allows to surpass 50% coverage of the genome
* The state of the art is to do a first PacBio sequencing to get a rough map to which I can attach subsequent precise Illumina paired-end reads
	* I want to use more than one Illumina run, with different lengths, so to discriminate repetitive regions and to correct errors in the PacBio phase
* Radiation hybrid maps now can be used for refining an assembly
	* I form an hybridome between an immortalized cell from a different species and a normal cell from the organism that I want to sequence
	* The hybrid will lose most of the genome of the normal cell, and it will retain a random fragment
	* In this way I can get a library (!)
	* The evaluation of the retained fragment is done by cariotyping thanks to banding patterns
	* I can then test by PCR to locate specific tags
	* By cross-referencing caryotype and PCR I can get a rough map of in which chromosome genes are (not so useful now, used in the pre-sequencing era)
	* If before the formation of the hybrid I irradiate the normal line, I break its DNA and get small fragments
	* In this case I want to have a very big library, where each clone has a small fragment
	* I can test by PCR in order to understand which markers from which chromosomes I get from each clone
	* If in my assembly I have a contig that I cannot locate, I design PCR primers for that region
	* I test all the library with the primers, and I select the clones that contain my tag
	* I check those clones for other markers of known position, and I check the ones that are more frequently associated with the tag of unknown position
	* In this way, I can say that the unallocated contig is physically linked to a tag of known position
	* The distance from between tags defined in this way is defined in cRay

# Study of genomes

## Linkage disequilibrium
* Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the nonrandom association of alleles at different loci
* I can define the LD coefficient $D_{AB}$ as the difference among the frequency of gametes carrying the combination of alleles AB, and the product of the independent frequencies of gametes with alleles A and B
$$ D_{AB} = p_{AB} - p_A*p_B $$
* If $D=0$ I am in linkage equilibrium (LE): the fequency of occurence of the AB aplotype is that expected from allele frequencies
* $D$ decreases in generations at a rate that depends on the frequency of recombination among the 2 loci
$$ D_{AB}(t+1) = (1-c)*D_{AB}(t)$$
* LE will always be reached, albeit usually really slowly
	* Even in loci in unlinked loci, $D$ only halves each generation
* The normalised version of $D$, called $D'$, is the ration with its maximum possible value
$$ D' = D/D_{max}$$
* Another often used metric is $r^2$, which is related to $D$ and is the correlation coefficient of the 2*2 genotype matrix
$$r^2 = \frac{D^2}{p_A(1- p_A)*p_B(1-p_B)}$$


* We can detect crossing-over by looking for the association of genetic markers
* An aplotype is a cluster of genes that are usually eredited toghether
* The probability of CO between 2 genes is measured in cM
	* 1 cM is a genetic distance such that in 100 meiosis I expect 1 CO
	* It is around $10^6$ nucleotides for mammals
* If I have a simple dominant trait, I am certain only about the allele frequency of the recessive
	* I can recover it by $recessive\ allele = \sqrt{recessive\ phenotype}$
	* Doing this, I am assuming that the population is infinite, there is no mutation, no selection, no genetic drift, no migration, random mating
* If the observed genotype frequencies are different from the ones expected from HW equilibrium, It means that there are factors at play that perturbate the equilibrium
	* There can also be genotyping problems (my region is difficult to sequence and I do not get the right sequence)
* Two loci are in linkage disequilibrium if they do not occur randomly with respect to each other
* Aplotypes are patterns of genetic variation in populations
* The genotype is not sufficient for predicting the aplotypes
	* I cannot differentiate if a variation is in one chromosome or the other (!)
	* We need information on aplotype frequencies or on the parents
* PHASE is a website for analyzing aplotypes
* I cannot determine the aplotype by only looking at the genotype: I need data on the population

## Signatures of selection
* A selective sweep is the reduction or elimination of variation among the nucleotides in neighboring DNA of a mutation as the result of recent and strong positive natural or artificial selection
	* The DNA sequence is analysed in a 40 kbp sliding window in pooled sequence data
	* The number of reads corresponding to the 2 alleales is evaluated for each SNP
		* I count the number of reads with the major allele ($n_{MAJ}$) and with the minor allele ($n_{MIN}$)
	* This leads to estimating an heterozygosity score for each window position for each pool
$$ H_p = 2 \sum n_{MAJ} * \sum n_{MIN} / (\sum n_{MAJ} + \sum n_{MIN})^2$$
		* $\sum n_{MAJ}$ and $\sum n_{MIN}$ are respectively the sums of the number of reads for each category for all the SNPs in the window
		* If I have an homozigous region all the SNPs there will have their major allele more frequent!
		* $H_p=1$ is when the 2 alleles have equal frequency ($\sum n_{MAJ} = \sum n_{MIN}$)
		* $H_p=0$ when $\sum n_{MIN}=0$
	* The $H_p$ value is then normalized as
$$ Z_{H_p} = (H_p-\mu_{H_p})/\sigma_{H_p}$$
	* I can set a $Z_{H_p}$ threshold and call a selective sweep when the threshold is passed for a window position
	* Data is usually presented with a Manhattan plot with th $Z_{H_p}$ score of each window position plotted along the genome axis
		* Colors are used to distinguish where a cromosome ends and another start
* There are portions of mithocondrial DNA integrated in the nuclear genome
	* These are called NUMTS and they are mostly pseudogenes, but maybe some of them are functional
	* They are still being integrated, so they tend to be quite variable
	* The ones integrated most recently tend to be really similar to the mithocondrial sequences

## QTL mapping

## Genotyping
* Genotyping means to determine the genotype at one locus
* I can perform high throughput genotyping with beadchips
	* I have beads with primers that anneal in different positions in the genome, so to be evenly spaced and below the linkage disequilibrium lenght
	* The output of a beadchip is essentially a .map file with additional experimental information (signal intensity for the SNP)
	* The position of some probes in the genome is unknown, so the row of their SNP starts with 0 (chromosome) and ends with 0 (position)
* The main genotyping platforms are from Illumina and Affimetrix
* The probe is designed so to
	* Bind to a unique region (it has to be long enough!)
	* It has to have standard GC content, so I can melt all the chip at the same temperature
* The specific fragments to be genotyped are detected by primer extension
	* I have a primer right in front of a SNP
	* I add the 2 possible nucleotides for the SNP labeled with different fluorophores and blocked
	* I see what happens
* The minor allele frequency (MAF) is the frequency of the rarer variant of a SNP
	* It can go from 0 to 0.5
* I do not need to genotype all the SNPs
	* I can take advantage of linkage disequilibrium to detect aplotypes
	* Polimorphic sites are more informative than sites with rare variants, so I tend to focus on them for determining an aplotype
* Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) allows to detect unknown SNPs and it is typically done with pooled reduced representation libraries
* Illumina can produce customized genotyping chips

## Dealing with repeated sequences
* They can be spotted with repeat masker
* This tool can mark SINE, LINE, Alu and will mask it in my sequence
* Masking means to substitute a sequence with a stretch of NNNN of the same length
* Pseudogenes can be processed or non processed (with introns) and they are not recognised by repeatmasker

## DNA chips
* In human the average linkage disequilibrium is low, around 1kb
* When effective population size is low, likage disequilibrium is large
	* This is true for lifestock
* In DNA sequencing chips, I detect a series of SNPs distanced about the linkage disequilibrium
	* If 2 SNPs are close enough, I can infer that the sequence in between is what I would expect from the aplotype

## GWAS
* I want to find the association between a phenotype and a genomic locus
* I can genotype individuals with a SNPs array and see if there is association with the phenotype
	* I check allele frequencies that differ in the different cohorts
* The result is a Manhattan plot
	* I have the chromosome lenght on the x axis (coordinate of the SNPs)
	* In the y axis I have the -log of the p-value for the association
		* Lower p-values are on the highest part (!)
* I am doing a lot of multiple testing so my threshold must be really high (!)
	* I use the Bonferroni correction or false discovery rate
* Continuous traits tend to be normally distributed
	* On a SNPs A/G I can have 3 possible genotypes: AA, AG, GG
	* I measure the genotype of each individual and its continuous trait
	* I take the means of the groups for each genotype and I perform a statistical test on means, like ANOVA
* In order to maximize the differences between pools, I can take samples from the extreme ends of the phenotype distribution
	* This is called extreme phenotype study

## Runs of Homozigosity
* The inbreeding coefficient indicates the probability that random positions among 2 individuals are equal by descent
	* It is calculated by tracing a close path on the pedigree of an individual
* Runs of homozigosity (ROH) refer to stretches of chromosome which are completely homozygus
	* This could mean that the 2 stretches are identical by descent (!)
	* The ROH % is equivalent to the coefficient of inbreeding
