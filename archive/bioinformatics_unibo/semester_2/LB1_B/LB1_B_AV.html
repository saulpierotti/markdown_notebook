<ul>
<li>The binding sites for small molecules tend to be small and deep</li>
<li>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be approached in from different perspectives
<ul>
<li>The reductionist approach focuses on specific molecules of interest and analyses specific interactions
<ul>
<li>It aimes at predicting parteners and modes of interaction</li>
<li>It requires wet-lab experiments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The protein network approach focuses on a set of proteins that interact with each other
<ul>
<li>It relies on the underlying biology and focuses on predicting new interactions</li>
<li>It can identify hubs of proteins that frequently interact with each other</li>
<li>A singleton is a protein that has only one interaction partner</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The systemâ€™s biology approach uses matematical models that rely on differential equations
<ul>
<li>The inputs to the equations are parameters that describe the biological system, such as pH and redox potential</li>
<li>It focuses on perturbation to the system</li>
<li>It can rely on experiment to determine the effect of a perturbation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interactions can be among proteins, with other non-protein macromolecules or with small molecules
<ul>
<li>In this course we will focus on interactions among proteins (PPIs)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several ways to classify PPIs
<ul>
<li>Interactions can be direct or indirect</li>
<li>Binary interactions or protein complexes (2 or many interactors)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The protein binding interface is defined as the set of atoms of a protein which are less than 5  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn000.png" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=19 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\AA" /> apart from an atom of the partner protein</li><li>PPIs are an essential part of signal transduction, enzimatic activity, cellular division, metabolic networks</li>
<li>Protein ligands can take part in catalitic mechanisms, regulation, and other biological activities</li>
<li>PPIs can be classified depending on the biological context, binding permanence, similarity of binding partners and number of partners</li>
<li>Transient interaction persist for a short time, while permanent interactions are more persistent
<ul>
<li>Transient interactions are typically mediated by short linear motives, PTMs, disorder-to-order transitions</li>
<li>Stable interactions form homo- and hetero-oligomeric protein complexes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conformational changes can alter PPIs (!)</li>
<li>The interactome is the set of interaction in a give compartment</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="driving-force-of-protein-ligand-interctions">Driving force of protein-ligand interctions</h1>
<ul>
<li>To maintain the order observed in biological systems, work is required
<ul>
<li>Protein folding requires work to be accomplished, since it requires a local entropy reduction</li>
<li>The synthesis of macromolecules requires the energy deriving from ATP hydrolsys</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The spontaneity of chemical reactions is expressed in terms of variation in Gibbs free energy ( <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn001.png" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta G" />)<ul>
<li>It is a state function: it does depend only on the initial and final state of the transition, not on the path followed</li>
<li>It represent the energy of a system that can be used to produce work</li>
<li>It can be related to 3 other state functions: temperature (T), entropy (S) and entalpy (H)
<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn002.png" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=16 STYLE="vertical-align: -3px; margin: 0;" alt="G = H - TS" /></li></ul></li>
<li>A decrease of G (a negative  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn001.png" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta G" />) indicates a spontaneous process</li></ul></li>
<li>Biological systems exist in a constant pressure and constant temperature environment: we can neglect changes in temperature
<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn003.png" WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=16 STYLE="vertical-align: -3px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S" /></li></ul></li>
<li>The entalpy of a system is a term that condenses its internal energy (E), volume (V) and pressure (P)
<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn004.png" WIDTH=98 HEIGHT=16 STYLE="vertical-align: -3px; margin: 0;" alt="H = E + PV" /></li></ul></li>
<li>The internal energy E is composed of a kinetic and a potential term
<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn005.png" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=16 STYLE="vertical-align: -3px; margin: 0;" alt="E = U + K" /></li></ul></li>
<li>Biological systems are typically in a solid or liquid state: we can ignore volume and pressure changes
<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn006.png" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta H \approx \Delta E" /></li><li>This is valid for bond formation/breaking, variation in weak interactions, variation in atomic motion indiced by heat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since we are at constant pressure, variations in entalpy equate heat transfer with the environment (Q)
<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn007.png" WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=19 STYLE="vertical-align: -5px; margin: 0;" alt="Q_p \approx \Delta E \approx \Delta H" /></li></ul></li>
<li>When bonds are broken, energy is released:  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn008.png" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta H &gt; 0" /></li><li>When bonds are formed, energy is absorbed from the environment:  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn009.png" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta H &lt; 0" /></li><li>Entropy (S) is a quantity related to the number of microstates ( <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn010.png" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Omega" />) that correspond to a given macrostate<ul>
<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn011.png" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=19 STYLE="vertical-align: -4px; margin: 0;" alt="S = K_b \ln{\Omega}" /></li><li>A microstate is a unique atomic configuration</li>
<li>A macrostate is an observable state of the system that can correspond to many unique atomic configurations</li>
<li>At constant temperature we observe that  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn012.png" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=26 STYLE="vertical-align: -7px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H}{T} = \frac{Q_p}{T}" /></li></ul></li>
<li>A process is at equilibrium when  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn013.png" WIDTH=59 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta G = 0" />, endoergonic when  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn014.png" WIDTH=59 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta G &gt; 0" /> and exoergonic when  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn015.png" WIDTH=59 HEIGHT=14 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\Delta G &lt; 0" /></li><li>Protein folding is spontaneous since the entropy reduction of the protein is more than offset from the entropy increase of the solvent
<ul>
<li>Entropy increase of water molecule of the solvent is a driving force in many biological processes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ligand binding is driven by the hydrophobic effect and Van der Waals interactions
<ul>
<li>PPI interfaces tend to be hydrophobic</li>
<li>The binding of small molecules is typically guided by geometry of the binding pocket and elecrtrostatic interaction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The size of a PPI surface is related to the binding strenght
<ul>
<li>Standard interfaces are 1200 to 2000  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn016.png" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=19 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\AA^2" /></li><li>Low stability complexes have interfaces of 1150-1200  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn016.png" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=19 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\AA^2" /></li><li>Small molecules interact with proteins in a 300-100  <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn016.png" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=19 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="\AA^2" /> area, typically in deep pockets</li></ul></li>
<li>PPI interfaces tend to be flat and without pockets
<ul>
<li>The center of the interface tends to be particularly conserved</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transient interfaces tend to be smaller, more hydrophobic and with better complementarity</li>
<li>Homomeric interfaces resemble protein cores while heteromeric interfaces look more like non-binding surfaces</li>
<li>The specificity of binding is given by electrostatic interactions
<ul>
<li>These also prevent aggregation</li>
<li>Specificity is low if a protein can bind many partners</li>
<li>PPI affinity ranges from pM to mM, but they are typically quite specific</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some binding energies to be rembered
<ul>
<li>General range: -2.5 to -22 kcal/mol</li>
<li>Interactions in signal transduction are weak</li>
<li>Cofactor binding: -5.5 gto -9.5 kcal/mol</li>
<li>Antigen-antibody: -5 to -11 kcal/mol</li>
<li>Enzyme-inhibitor: -9 to -15 kcal/mol</li>
<li>Enzyme-transition state: -17 to -27 kcal/mol</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interaction hotspots are PPI interfaces that are quite heterogeneous
<ul>
<li>The binding strenght is typically given by a few hydrophobic residues (hotspots)</li>
<li>They can be identified by alanine replacement: if we replace an hospot with alanine the affinity changes of at least 2 kcal/mol</li>
<li>Alanine replacement can also be done in silico (alanine scanning)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hotspots tend to account for less than 50% of the interaction surface, are quite conserved, appear in clusters
<ul>
<li>They are frequently represented by aromatic residues (F, Y, W)</li>
<li>They are surrounded by less important residues that shields them from the solvent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="protein-docking">Protein docking</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is biologically important to understand the molecular position of a ligand on a protein (its pose)</li>
<li>Docking finds the optimal interaction, but cannot determine if the interaction actually happens or if it has a biological meaning</li>
<li>Molecular docking is an optimization problem: we want to maximize the interaction of the ligand with the protein by operating on their torsion angles
<ul>
<li>We want to maximise electrostatic and geometric affinity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We first perform a step called pose generation that explores the conformational space, and subsequently we rank the possible solutions</li>
<li>A ligand can be a small molecule or also a macromolecule
<ul>
<li>Binding sites for ligands are small and deep</li>
<li>Peptides are 8-10 aminoacid long and tend to have a floppy backbone</li>
<li>Proteins tend to have rigid backbones: interfaces are large and flat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Docking is a golden standard in PPIs, because it is reliable, but it is computationally expensive: it is not an high throughput method</li>
<li>A must for docking is to have a good 3d structure or model
<ul>
<li>Usually a crystal structure is better than an homology model, but also a crystal is a kind of model, it can be wrong (!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In order to test a docking method, I can take a structure with a co-crystalised ligand
<ul>
<li>I artificially separate the molecules and compare the docking prediction with the experimental data</li>
<li>This method is called bound docking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the contrary, in unbound docking it may be that I am using a structure for a protein that is in the wrong conformation for the interaction
<ul>
<li>It is far more complex than bound docking</li>
<li>A structure is defined native if in an uncomplexed state, pseudonative if complexed with a ligand different from the one used in the docking</li>
<li>I can also do unbound docking on a model</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Typical limitations of the apprach are: conformational changes, errors in the structures or models, limited computing resources</li>
<li>In order to do docking I need a representation of the protein surface
<ul>
<li>The kind of representation that I use will influence the algorithms that I can employ for the docking</li>
<li>I can use mathematical models that describe its shape and electrostatic proprieties</li>
<li>The protein frame can be treated in a static or dynamic way</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I can consider the protein and its ligand as rigid or flexible
<ul>
<li>Rigid docking can explore the whole protein surface and it is faster, but less accurate
<ul>
<li>Rigid docking algorithms proved to be useful for enzyme-inhibitor and antigen-antibody docking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Semi-flexible docking treats the ligand as flexible and the protein as rigid</li>
<li>Flexible docking treats everything as flexible: it is more accurate but really slow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The search algorithms can work in different ways, but it produces an enormous number of solutions ( <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn017.png" WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=17 STYLE="vertical-align: -1px; margin: 0;" alt="10^9" />)<ul>
<li>Brute-force the solution space</li>
<li>Guided progression through the solution space, sometimes only considering solution that confrom to pre-determined criteria</li>
<li>Data-driven: uses the available information about interface residues</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scoring functions are needed for ranking the possible solutions, and they can use different approaches
<ul>
<li>They can use a force field, a set of parameters that define the potential energy of a system and it is based on molecular mechanics</li>
<li>Empirical functions are simpler and use a reduced description of the most important interactions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The initial screening of poses is usually based on geometric criteria, then top-ranking conformations are discriminated with more advanced methods based on energy contributions</li>
<li>The native pose tends to belong to a cluster of high-scoring poses
<ul>
<li>Events that occur in cluster tend to not be random</li>
<li>The native pose is typically at the center of the most populated cluster of solutions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CAPRI is an international competition for docking algorithms organised by EBI, like the CASP is for structure prediction</li>
<li>ClusPro and HADDOCK are 2 docking web-servers</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ppi-data-and-databases">PPI data and databases</h1>
<ul>
<li>There are databases that collect only experimental data, and databases with computationally-derived interactions</li>
<li>Experimental data are not always more reliable than computationally derived ones (!)
<ul>
<li>There are no experimental method that can replicate binary interactions under physiological conditions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Low-thoroughput techniques can be more reliable of high-thorughput ones</li>
<li>High-troughput techniques: yeast-2-hybrid, affinity purification MS</li>
<li>Medium-troughput techniques:</li>
<li>Low-troughput techniques:</li>
<li>Methods can be binary or co-complex
<ul>
<li>Co-complex methods can detect non-direct interactions among proteins, i.e.Â if they belong to the same complex</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) is fast and scalable, but has disadvantages
<ul>
<li>An yeast protein can act as a bridge and give a false interaction</li>
<li>The conditions in yeast can not be physiological</li>
<li>The proteins that I am studying could in reality reside in different compartments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affinity purification MS: affinity chromatografy and the MS
<ul>
<li>It is in vitro (!)</li>
<li>I cannot identify proteins in really low amounts by MS, and proteins that are not in databases</li>
<li>False positives due to breakage of cell compartments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Co-immunoprecipitation: antibodies interact with protein A, that interacts with protein B
<ul>
<li>With the antibody I can pull down protein B</li>
<li>Similar pros and cons with affinity purification MS</li>
<li>The interactors can be studied by MS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>X-ray crystallography: high detail level but challenging
<ul>
<li>Very low troughput</li>
<li>Artificial environment</li>
<li>There are false positives and negatives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data must be accessible and intellegible to the user
<ul>
<li>It requires a lot of effort to implement, curate and maintain PPI databases</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the past data producers where also data analyzers</li>
<li>Today this is not possible any more: specialized jobs and not enough time and resources for data producers</li>
<li>Data should comply with the FAIR principles
<ul>
<li>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable</li>
<li>We want unique and persistent data identifiers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Primary databases: experimental interactions manually curated
<ul>
<li>IntAct, MINT</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Secondary (meta) databases: integration of primary databases
<ul>
<li>APID, PINA</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prediction databases: integration of experimental predictions with computational predictions
<ul>
<li>STRING</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IMEx is an international consortium of interaction data providers who share curation efforts
<ul>
<li>Data is curated once and then shared among members</li>
<li>Curation is entirely manual</li>
<li>Data is provided in standard formats: MITAB or PSI-MI XML 2.5</li>
<li>UniProt, MINT, IntAct are in the consortium</li>
<li>STRING is NOT in IMEx because it includes predictions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The ideal would be to have a single database to uniform interface and data mining, but this is not possible</li>
<li>A good compromise: standards and guidelines to uniform data access and retrieval</li>
<li>The problem of standards: creating a standard to uniform previous competing standards create just one more competing standard</li>
<li>PSIQUIC is an unified query client interface for retrieving data from some biological databases
<ul>
<li>It provides links to the included databases</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mentha and virus-mentha are interactome databases</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="interaction-networks">Interaction networks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Material was extracted from the EBI online course</li>
<li>Networks are everywhere</li>
<li>They where first studied in the context of social networks</li>
<li>Euler first represented a problem with a graph: Koenisberg 7 bridges</li>
<li>Networks are useful when dealing with large amounts of data</li>
<li>Network biology is a branch of system biology</li>
<li>Indirected networks: no direction in the interactions, es PPI networks</li>
<li>Directed networks: unidirectional interaction, metabolic networks and gene regulation</li>
<li>Weighted networks: edge encode a weight such as the reliability of an interaction, the quantitative expression induction, sequence similarity of genes</li>
<li>A graph can be represented by an adiacency matrix
<ul>
<li>1 means connected, 0 not connected</li>
<li>In an undirected network the matrix is symmetric, in a directed network it is not</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The topology of a network refers to its connectivity
<ul>
<li>A topological cluster is more connected to itself than to other parts of the network</li>
<li>The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it</li>
<li>A network is scale-free if it has a small number of high degree nodes and many nodes with low degree</li>
<li>The degree centrality of a node tells us how relevant is a node for the entire network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Our knowledge of interaction networks is noisy and incomplete</li>
<li>Some features about a network could change in the future, when more data are available</li>
<li>Small world effect: the shortest path among any 2 nodes tends to be small: 6 degrees of separation
<ul>
<li>Signals are quick and efficient, and reliable</li>
<li>Perturbating a single node does not cause enormous alterations on the network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PPINs are tendentially scale-free: many nodes with few connections and a few hubs
<ul>
<li>A random mutation in the network is unlikely to hit an hub</li>
<li>It is vulnerable to targeted attack on hubs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PPINs have high transitivity: many clusters with many internal interactions</li>
<li>The PSI-MI score assigns the reliability of interactions
<ul>
<li>It evaluates the number of independent publications advocating for an interaction, the type of experiment that supports it and the interaction type</li>
<li>Interaction type refers to direct or indirect</li>
<li>It is a normalized score so it ranges from 0 to 1, above 0.4 the interaction is quite reliable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The study of centrality of a network tries to understand which nodes/edges are essential for the functioning of the network
<ul>
<li>Drug targets are typically centralities of their networks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Centrality can be measured in different ways
<ul>
<li>Degree of the node: it is a local measure that ignores the structure of the network</li>
<li>Global centrality and betweennes centrality: global measures</li>
<li>Random walks: average distance of the path from a random node to the one of interest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Closeness centrality: how short is the shortest path from node i to any other node
<ul>

<li> <img class="inlinemath" src="eqn019.png" WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=23 STYLE="vertical-align: -8px; margin: 0;" alt="\sum_j d(i,j)" /> is the farness metric: the distance to every other node</li><li>I can represent farness of all node pairs also with a symmetric matrix</li>
<li>Summing each row and dividing for N-1 I get the CC for each node</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Betweeness centrality: the number of shortest paths passing through node i between nodes j and k
