* JCE has been removed from the PDB website
* I can use TopMatch for pairwise structural alignment, and Mustang for multiple structural alignment
* Molecular visualization softwares in order to show secondary structure use algorithms that compute the position of hydrogens
	* Jahnet Tornhton developped one of the most used algorithms
	* DSSP is another algorithm developped by Sander and Kabasch
	* First hydrogens are added according to the chemical properties of elements
	* DSSP uses a purely electrostatic definition to assign hydrogen bonding patterns and, from this, secondary structure
* A protein is a stable entity when there is the right combination of residues that allow the backbone to fold in the solvent space
* An hydrogen bond is on average $2 \AA$ long
* The atoms involved in the H bonding should be strongly electronegative
	* The H is in a frustrated, unstable position
* In an alpha-helix H bonds occur with the 4th following residue
* H-bonding happens both in solvent-accessible and solvent-unaccessible regions
* Protein with the same secondary structure topology are probably similar also in tertiary structure
	* This is in spite of primary structure
* A genetic variant of a protein (an allele with a single aminoacid difference) can have a different stability than the original protein allele
* A variation in $\Delta G$ among 2 proteins due to a genetic variant, called $\Delta \Delta G$ can increase or decrease protein stability
	* If $\Delta \Delta G > 1.0$ the variation increases protein stability
	* If $\Delta \Delta G < -1.0$ the variation decreases protein stability
	* If $\Delta \Delta G < -1.0$ the variation decreases protein stability
	* If $1.0 < \Delta \Delta G < 1.0$ the variation has little effect on protien stability
